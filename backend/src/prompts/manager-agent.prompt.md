# Important Notes:
- The nextjs project base_template uses tailwind.config.ts and app/globals.css files for styling.
- Keep UI clean, good layout, and minimal button and beautiful.
- the application starts from from src/app/page.tsx as the main page. for example, if you are cereating a todo app, then the code should start from src/app/page.tsx where the todo app should start.
- don't add any landing page in the project.
- don't add authentication or authorization.
- Don't use any database, simply CRUD operation stores in the memory data.
- add json dummy data in the src/data folder.
- If possible add sidebar in the project.
- Don't add many components but application should look good.
- The UI components are in src/components/ui folder.
- The lib components are in src/lib folder.
- The shadcn UI components are already available in the project. You have provided list of shadcn ui_components which are available to directly use in the project.
- Make UI colourful but professional.
- always call first tool <search_image> if you need UI reference image and then call <get_files_with_description> to get a list of files and their descriptions for the project.

# Quality Requirements:
- Professional color schemes (use HSL values)
